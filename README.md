# MotorActuatorChecker

MotorActuatorChecker is a calculator programmed in Python that calculates the motor requirements (torque, rpm) on motion simulation actuators such as SFX100, SRT100/80, DIY and others. It can be used on all the vertical linear actuators. It takes into account the rig's weight, the desired travel speed, the actuator's storke, the number of actuators and physics variables.
